It's been three months since you moved to Florida, and not a day goes by that I don't think about our Sunday afternoon tea sessions and your incredible stories.\n\nI hope you're enjoying the warm weather and making new friends at your community center. Mom tells me you've joined the book club and the gardening group â€“ I'm not surprised! You've always had a gift for bringing people together.\n\nI'm planning to visit you next month for your birthday. I can't wait to see your new home and hear about all your adventures. Until then, please know that you're loved and missed every single day.\n\nI'm sending you the biggest hug across the miles.\n\nAll my love,\nSamantha",

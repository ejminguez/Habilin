That was the day I felt a kind of happiness I didn’t even know was possible.\n\nTbh, love, I didn’t expect na aabot tayo dito. LDR pa jud ta from the very start, and we both know how hard that is. But despite everything, we made it. And I’m so, so thankful nga wala ka ni biya sa akoa. Thank you for choosing me every day.\n\nHonestly, I don’t even know how to put everything I feel into words. But know this, I’m so grateful you came into my life. You made my days lighter, my life fuller, and my heart happier. You even brought me closer to God again. That alone means so much.\n\nI also really admire your strength, baby. I saw it especially during DYD. Didto jud ko nabilib nimo. Bisan unsa pa kalisod, you pushed through. And love, even with everything you’re facing in life like your family problems, financial struggles, and all the other challenges, you still manage to keep going. You didn’t let it break you. I’m not romanticizing your pain, love… I just deeply admire how you handle everything. You’re one of the strongest people I know, and I’m so proud of you.\n\nFirst kita nato, idk pero na hook ko, haaysss. You didn’t even have to do anything big. It was your smile, your laugh, the way your eyes disappear when you’re happy. Imohang nose pag mag pa cute ka (kabalo naka unsa na). The way you take care of me, understand me, and love me aaaahh grabe. You’re really something else, bab.\n\nI love youuu, baby. Happy 2nd anniversaryyyyyy to us. Sana mag grow pa tayo together forever and ever HAHHAHHA.",
